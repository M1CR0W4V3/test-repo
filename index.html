        <h1>Local Table Tennis Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the local table tennis website. We are open currently from 7:30pm - 10:00pm
            As members of the community and the surrounding areas such as; Apalachin, Binghamton, Endwell, Johnson City and Owego,
             we have established a Table Tennis Club (Ping-Pong) in the area.</p>
        <p>For those who do not know a lot about table tennis, it is a lively and energetic paddle game to be enjoyed by all! It is our job
             as a club to bring quality equipment, facilities, and players together for the greater good and for the community. Similarly, we are looking 
             to expand to the people in the area.</p>
        <p>People who enjoy the sport or wish to learn are welcome to come and join the competition!</p>
